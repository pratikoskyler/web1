        <p>I am <b>EXTREMELY</b> addicted to this <sup>game</sup> and I bought this game for $15 when it was on sale and let me tell you, it was one of the <u><b><i>best decisions</i></b></u> I have ever made in my life. The game got me hooked from the start and after 6 months of playing, I have finally beaten the story. That's how good it is. The story is <mark>absolutely top-tier</mark> to me, and I've spent over 500 hours (in total) playing the game. If you ever see it on sale, DON'T HESITATE TO <sub><del>PIRATE</del></sub> BUY IT.</p>
